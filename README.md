# Named_Entity_Recognition
This work focuses on implementing a Named Entity Recognition system in Python for both Spanish and Dutch, using the conll2002 corpus available in both languages. To achieve this, we will leverage Conditional Random Fields and employ BIO, IO, and BIOW encodings.

It's worth highlighting the implementation of a function that, using the displacy.render function from the SpaCy library, visually tags real texts with our trained CRF from sklearn.
